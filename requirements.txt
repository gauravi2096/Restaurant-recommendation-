# All dependencies for Streamlit app (Phases 1–3).
# Use this file as the requirements file in Streamlit Cloud if using default "requirements.txt".
# FastAPI is required because phase2_api package imports .api (create_app) at load time.
# datasets, pandas, huggingface_hub are required for first-time DB creation (pipeline runs when restaurants.db is missing).
